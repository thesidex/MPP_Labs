Explain why this has happened:
 
On the initial implementation, the equals() method
Overridden in the Person class was implemented by comparing only the 'name'
field but in the PersonWithJob class equals() method it was comparing the
'name 'and 'salary' fields which is not a consistent comparison so it returns
false.

Initially, p1 (PersonWithJon type) equals() method compares name and salary
field and since p2 was a Person type it didn't have salary field so it
generates false. And p2.equals(p1) returned true because only the name field was
compared in the equals() method in p2 which is of Person type.
